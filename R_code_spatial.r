# plot of coordinates, only to see the points in space

## importing new data
# downloaded covid_agg.csv from iol and build a folder called lab into users
# put the file in the folder lab

# setting the working directory: lab 
# for mac users

# we name the dataset covid and link it with the data using <-, so we are linking a function with an object
# plus we state that the first line is the description of the columns

# let's do a plot considering the n of cases per country 
attach(covid)

#in case you don't attach covid you should write plot(covid$country,covid$cases)
#to see all the countries we should make the labels of the countries vertical with labels which is called las
plot(country, cases, las=0) #parallel labels
plot(country, cases, las=1) # all horizontal labels
plot(country, cases, las=2) # labels are perpendicular 
plot(country, cases, las=3) # labels are vertical 

# we decrease the size of the labels of the x axis

# let's plot spatially using ggplot
# to make a ggplot you need: data, aesthetic mapping which are the variables, type of symbol we want to use
#ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2) #or require(ggplot2)
